# front-end-library
A library of code snippets that demonstrate different concepts and how to use a variety of technologies. Also an organized repository of my beginner work as a programmer. Filled with games, portfolios, and Hello World apps.

This library is organized in to three main categories: Utilities Styling, and Games. Utilities include API's and data queries. The Styling category includes various CSS code snippets. In the Games category you will find various small games that are built to demonstrate core Web Dev concepts in a fun way.
Check back soon for updates.
